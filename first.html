        <!-- Linked another html using an anchor -->
         <a href="linked_file.html" target="_blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">First Linked F</a>

         <!-- rel is used to describe the relationn between the current page and the linked docuement. The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. The noreferrer value pervents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a linke. The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.
